# Contributing to Safe Feature Addition

We welcome contributions to make this toolkit even more robust!

## How to Contribute

1.  **Report Bugs**: Open an issue describing the bug and how to reproduce it.
2.  **Suggest Features**: share your ideas for new patterns or automation scripts.
3.  **Submit PRs**: 
    - Fork the repo.
    - Create a feature branch.
    - Ensure your code follows the established patterns.
    - Update documentation (README.md and SKILL.md) if necessary.

## Standards

-   **Safety First**: Any new code must prioritize additive changes and backward compatibility.
-   **Aesthetics**: Documentation should be clean and use Mermaid diagrams where possible.
